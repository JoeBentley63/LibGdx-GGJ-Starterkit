A simple starter kit for GGJ 2016.

A generated simple project, with a good foundation. 
Includes:
-Loading screen
-Game screen
-Asset management (can really be removed, but whatever)
-Also added a very simple game of pong as an example game people can hack into whatever form they need.

As a wise man once said "We'll take pong, and swap it out for a sniper game. Easy" haha
